\chapter{User Study}
\label{ch:UserStudy}

In Chapter \ref{ch:Tool}, we described the design and implementation of
\toolname{} with a particular focus on how it might be used as part of a
software development workflow, and its user interface.
\par The development of \toolname{} was guided by two research questions.
First, we ask whether enriching data-flow and reachability information with 
additional context (\eg displaying a node in a data-flow analysis in its 
original context in code) has an effect on the cognitive load of software 
developers in a program comprehension task.
Second, we ask whether the same enrichment of data-flow and reachability
information has an effect on the completeness of program comprehension tasks
performed by developers.
To investigate these questions, we conducted a user study where participants 
were asked to complete two program comprehension tasks with and without the 
ability to use \toolname{}.
We discuss the tasks in Section \ref{sec:Tasks} and describe the experimental
design of the study and the recruitment of our subjects in Section
\ref{sec:ExperimentalDesign}, and Section \ref{sec:Recruitment}, respectively.
Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results in Section
\ref{sec:Results}.

\section{Participant Recruitment}
\label{sec:Recruitment}

We sought out subjects who ideally had experience working as professional
software developers.
Our study was advertised on Twitter and on personal mailing lists.
Subjects who reported writing software at a frequency of less than once a month 
were excluded from our study.
Each subject was provided compensation in the form of a raffle entry to win
one out of five gift cards to an e-commerce site valued at \$\cardamount{} each.
