\noindent In Chapter \ref{ch:Tool}, we detailed how a user might use
\toolname{} in a software development workflow, and discussed its design and 
implementation.
In this chapter, we return to the research questions we investigated in
evaluating our plugin:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \textbf{RQ1:} What is the effect of \toolname{} on a developer's 
  cognitive load as they analyze a system to answer reachability questions?
  \item[] \textbf{RQ2:} Does \toolname{} have an effect on the completeness
  of the analysis by a developer as they use it to help answer reachability 
  questions?
\end{itemize}

A number of approaches have been taken to measure and approximate cognitive
load in the context of software development.
