\noindent In Chapter \ref{ch:Tool}, we detailed how a user might use
\toolname{} in a software development workflow, and discussed the design and 
implementation of \toolname{}.
In this chapter, we return to the research questions we investigated in
evaluating our plugin:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \textbf{RQ1:} What is the effect of \toolname{} on a developer's 
  cognitive load as they analyze a system to answer reachability questions?
  \item[] \textbf{RQ2:} Does \toolname{} have an effect on the type of 
  information viewed by a developer as they analyze a system to answer
  reachability questions?
\end{itemize}
