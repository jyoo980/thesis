\chapter{Survey}
\label{ch:Survey}

\noindent We deployed a survey to investigate the type and frequency of
questions that developers may encounter during their day-to-day activities.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

\noindent The survey was developed with the goal of maximizing the relevance of 
the presented questions to actual scenarios that developers would encounter in
their day-to-day work.
We drew upon our previous work as software developers as well as the literature
for reachability questions \cite{latoza-2010-reach} and hard-to-answer
questions about code that developers ask \cite{latoza-2010-hard-questions}.
From these sources, we drafted a set of 10 questions that we hypothesized 
developers may ask as they performed change tasks or explored their programs.

\par After piloting the survey in a laboratory setting with 7 graduate
students, we converged on a survey with 9 questions with corresponding code
excerpts with a time-to-completion of about 10 minutes.
The survey was deployed entirely online, and consisted of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 5 demographic questions.
    \item 9 Likert-scale questions that each represented a hypothetical 
          scenario associated with a program comprehension or reachability 
          question.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: describe the survey (use tables?) attach it to this. Make a footnote,

\subsection{Participant Recruitment}
\label{subsec:ParticipantRecruitment}

\noindent We tweeted the survey to a combined audience of over 2000
accounts at the time of distribution.
In addition to Twitter, the survey was distributed using mailing lists to
professional software developers.

% TODO: come back to this once we can actually say more about  what we  build
\par As our tool relies heavily on static program information, we excluded
respondents who have never used a statically-typed language as their primary
development language. 
We also excluded individuals who do not write code at least once a month,
as they may not be the primary audience for our tool.
