\chapter{Survey}
\label{ch:Survey}

\noindent We deployed a survey to investigate the type and frequency of
questions that developers may encounter during their day-to-day activities.

% TODO: say more?

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

\noindent The survey was developed with the goal of maximizing the relevance of 
the presented questions to actual scenarios that developers would encounter in
their day-to-day work.
We drew upon our previous work as software developers as well as the literature
for reachability questions \cite{latoza-2010-reach} and hard-to-answer
questions about code that developers ask \cite{latoza-2010-hard-questions}.
From these sources, we drafted a set of 10 questions that we hypothesized 
developers may ask as they performed change tasks or explored their programs.

\par After piloting the survey in a laboratory setting with 7 graduate
students, we converged on a survey with 9 questions with corresponding code
excerpts with a time-to-completion of about 10 minutes.
The survey was deployed entirely online, and consisted of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 5 demographic questions.
    \item 9 Likert-scale questions that each represented a hypothetical 
          scenario associated with a program comprehension or reachability 
          question.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: describe the survey (use tables?) attach it to this. Make a footnote,

\subsection{Participant Recruitment}
\label{subsec:ParticipantRecruitment}

\noindent We tweeted the survey to a combined audience of over 2000
accounts at the time of distribution.
In addition to Twitter, the survey was distributed using mailing lists to
professional software developers.

% TODO: come back to this once we can actually say more about  what we  build
\par As our tool relies heavily on static program information, we excluded
respondents who have never used a statically-typed language as their primary
development language. 
We also excluded individuals who do not write code at least once a month,
as they may not be the primary audience for our tool.

\section{Survey Results}

\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:ThreatsToValidity}

% TODO: think of an intro

\subsection{External Validity}
\label{subsec:ExternalValidity}

One of the ways which we distributed our survey was via a tweet on Twitter.
This means that part of our results may be specific to the responses of
software developers who use Twitter.
Consequently, it may be challenging to fully generalize our results across
the general population of developers who may not use Twitter.
In an attempt to minimize this threat to validity, we also distributed the 
survey using mailing lists to professional software developers, under the
assumption that most professional software developers use email.

\subsection{Construct Validity}
\label{subsec:ConstructValidity}

\noindent To create a set of survey questions that would closely represent the
questions and scenarios that developers reported to be most challenging
\cite{latoza-2010-hard-questions, latoza-2010-reach}, we designed a small Java
project represening an e-commerce system.
The Java methods presented in each survey question may not be entirely
representative of the actual code and systems that the respondents may have
experience with.
We deemed this to be an acceptable threat, as the code excerpts we drew from
the sample project were writen to distill the core concepts behind
reachability and program comprehension questions into a succinct representation.
Having overly-complicated code excerpts may have impacted the study by
increasing time-to-completion and drop rate.

\par Another threat to our construct validity is the fact that all the code
excerpts included in our survey were written in Java.
This does not account for the fact that our participants may have varying
levels of proficiency with Java.
Consequently, we may be conflating our results with the proficiency of our
participants with Java.
That being said, we needed to select a language for our study that would
have a high likelihood of being familiar to our target audience.
Java's sustained popularity as a development language meant that it was a
suitable choice.
